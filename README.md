This project creates a small Book Library app that users can use to
add their favorite books to a web-based library. Users can add books' title,
author, page number, and whether they have read the book or not. They can also
change the status of the book (e.g changing its status to read after finishing 
the book) and remove the book from the library. 

This project demonstrates various front-end skills such as:

- DOM manipulation in JavaScript;
- Using JavaScript objects for more organized and better structured code;
- Advanced use of Grid and Flexbox layouts to achieve a responsive design
intended for desktops;
- Use of an HTML form to get the required data from users;
- Use of a dialog box that pops up with a form when the user clicks its 
associated button;
- Use of various pseudo-classes to achieve a more accessible design.
